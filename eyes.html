                It can be uncomfortable to pass by a street
                where you remember your enemy often
                spends time at. You feel like they could be
                right behind you at any moment, piercing
                you with their eyes or even worse, trying to
                talk to you.

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>
                I didn't know I was going to have such a lecturer when I signed up for the Internet of Things class at
                Hongik University in Seoul, South Korea. David Hall had a very compelling argument to make about
                practical design. Is it really possible to find out exactly what the world needs by analysing every
                little bit and writing many post it notes? A controversial question, indeed. He told us about how
                Samsung worked towards creating a smart fridge. All the right steps; a detailed analysis of the target
                group, various prototypes and test, they spend a hefty portion of their money on this thing that had
                everything screaming for it's success. Everyone wanted it, no doubt. It was released and it tanked.
                Because truly, while everyone wanted it, nobody needed it. But how were you supposed to know? All sticky
                notes said yes. With this story, David concluded that there is no point trying to figure out what the
                world needs and analysing target groups. What is it that we truly want? He wanted us to go down to the
                nitty gritty of our minds, talk about our desires and worries and just go do something that is centered
                around something that we feel, because that is the only thing we can be certain of.

                <br><br>

                So I went for it. And one feeling that truly defines a good part of my whole being is how much I am
                scared to meet someone I know by chance when I'm out and about or even worse, someone I dislike or have
                a quarrel with. I always wished there to be a way to detect them, since I have pretty bad tunnel vision.
                Combining the feeling of a piercing stare and the practicality of a internet powered device I thought
                you could use the location data that everyone almost voluntarily spews out into the world (for example
                from Snapchat) to warn yourself when someone is about to approach you.

                Little spikes are arranged in a grid that you attach to your back. Using yourself as the center of
                the coordination system, it can track someone's position on a two dimensional plane so you can go and
                turn around before they can even detect you. Unfortunately the class with David ended early and we
                weren't able to make a proper prototype.
                <br><br>
                Pure red, black and white were chosen as the thematic color scheme. Red to represent the aggression but
                also fear, the irritation that an unwelcome encounter brings. It's literally seeing red, like an alert
                that goes off in situations of danger. Black and White because there are only two options: engage or run
                away. There is no comfortable middle ground, either you face your enemy or you don't.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                This concept aligns well with my asocial theory. The semester prior, I had developed a concept of an
                uninviting pavillion that would keep visitors away for a park in Mannheim so I could finally be at
                peace.
                <br><br>
                Especially in South Korea, a lot of the lifestyle seemed to predict what I felt was coming: a desire or
                even need to be asocial. It's nothing new that the newer generation spends less time physically with
                their friends, that they are more and more incapable of holding a face to face conversation. At the same
                time the number of bachelors as well as people living on their own have been increasing rapidly. In East
                Asia, it is not uncommon to see single seat tables in restaurants or streamers that do Mukbang, just
                eating on stream to make other people feel less lonely. And as I told more Koreans about my concept, it
                was met with cheers; they would love if that was something they could use. Social awkwardness is
                becoming more normal than ever. People are scared to commit to relationships and would probably be
                satisfied with sex robots. So I think I might be onto something.
