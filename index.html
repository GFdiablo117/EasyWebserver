            <h2>Is advertisement over?</h2>
            <p>In the wake of adblock and generations that stop watching TV or listening to the radio altogether, ads
               seem
               to struggle more than ever to reach their goals. Even though I am in the same industry, I find myself
               tuning out ads more often than looking at them with interest. People my age usually consume tailored
               content
               but
               at the same time don't like being spied on to receive tailored ads. We prefer genuinity, which seems to
               be
               inherently contrary to the very nature of ads. At most, they don't create new customers but only reaffirm
               their previous customers' buying decision. At the same, time ads are the basis of all free content
               online.
               There have been changes in how companies reach their target group nowadays. They switch to
               influencer-based
               ads and implement a "personality" by uploading politically charged ads. But I don't know if that is
               enough.
               The concept of advertisment has always left a bit of a bitter aftertaste. Of course there were many ads
               that
               were genuinely enjoyable and even shaped our culture. I feel like traditional advertisement might have
               met
               its end. But then again I don't really know the numbers. If it was that ineffective, surely companies
               would
               stop pouring millions and millions into them.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="messay">
            <h2>
               Should a designer know everything?
            </h2>
            <p>A designer connects the user to the service or product they aim to use in a way that is accessible to
               them.
               For example, many companies use software to organise their finances or flow of products. A designer makes
               the
               software usable for them. In order to make an interface that is both usable and understandable, they need
               to
               gain the necessary knowledge. In less obvious examples, the target group might be locally confined, so
               the
               designer needs to become acquainted with the local culture (ie. designing an App for China versus
               Brazil.) But where
               is
               the line? Surely a designer cannot be expected to be an expert in all fields possible. Yet it is
               recommended to
               stay on top of so many topics, such as current politics, global finances, cultures from varying
               countries,
               software, languages, sciences, sociology, etc, etc, etc. Is that too much asked or just what's necessary?
            </p>
         </div>

         <div class="messay">
            <h2>
               What exciting things can you make with mobile first? </h2>
            <p>It's nothing new that more and more sites are viewed primarily on mobile devices. Hence it is important
               to make the mobile design a priority. But I found myself to feel limited when I actually design the
               mobile site first. It's like it quickly becomes boring, trying to make a site that works with our clumsy
               fingertips. What is it about this approach that still feels lacking?
            </p>
         </div>

         <div class="messay">
            <h2>
               Why is the value of designers so unclear to so many people? </h2>
            <p>Many designers probably have heard at least a couple hundred times that people worry for their future
               financial security if they become designers. It seems as though it's a secret kept from the general
               public that
               design affects almost everything and that the bigger companies become, the more they pay for good design.
               You will be hard pressed to ask global players like Nike, Apple or Mercedes to sell their logo. I think a
               big part of the misconception is that many designers themselves don't seem to know their value and how
               difficult their skills can be to some people. Designing can be fun, like drawing or making music. But you
               need abilities like effective visual communication, empathy and knowing how to use computer programs. And
               those aren't as easy to come by as it seems sometimes.
