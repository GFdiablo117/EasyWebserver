                <br>
                Liveperson is a multinational service that provides an asynchronous messaging solution between customers
                and brands, using bots for chat and other solutions. They came to the faculty of software engineering to
                find a solution to make their services more accessible to clients who don't have as much programming
                experience. Combined with the skills of the design students, four teams of ten students competed to
                create the best solution. Our team was called Gryffindor, and that is a little spoiler for how the
                competition ended...

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>
                We started off getting to know one of another. It was the first time for most of us to work with or
                even meet a student from another department, which already posed a challenge. We had to figure out how
                to
                make use of our differences and how to communicate with each other. Personally, it was important for me
                to attend as many meetings as possible, especially since the focus was on the software side of things.
                Even though I didn't fully understand what they were doing, I would still make sure to ask what they are
                up to and become a member they can trust.
                <br><br>
                We designers sat together to figure out a userflow: How would someone without a programming background
                create a bot? It took us some time to
                figure out what exactly a user would need to see in order to create an effective chatbot without prior
                knowledge. The functions were mapped out by Liveperson: create an interface where you can create a bot
                that can greet, answer frequently asked questions and redirect to a human service agent if the chatter
                wants something else. The bots must have the ability to be turned on and off, fed content and features,
                and be
                trained. We compared other bot services that offer almost identical services and learned from them, as
                well as figured out what can be improved upon.
            </p>

                Since the deal was to make it easy and not intimidating, I suggested the name Bottertoast as brand name.
                It references the tradition of naming software after food and also adds a little silliness that I feel
                like we can all use in professional life every now and then. And though it was a bold idea, it was
                memorable and straight forward.
                <br><br>
                Some pages were easy to make; an overview of the bots as well as a form-based set up page, were
                straight forward tasks. But the actual configuration of the bot was both challenging and interesting. We
                thought if you were making a chat, why not display it as a chat? A more powerful chat interface that
                allows you to create parallel responses to different requests.
            </p>

            <p>
                From the chat concept, we moved on to implement the chatbubble theme in other areas. They became buttons
                and the shape of our form fields. We settled for both a bright theme as well as a dark one that is
                friendlier to the eye. A buttery yellow was an easy choice for obvious reasons, and a complementing dark
                blue balances and adds a professional feeling.
                <br><br>
                We also wanted the bots to seem less technical and more like partners. So we changed wording into "born"
                instead of "created" and "asleep" instead of "inactive."

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>This was my first multidisciplinary class where I could prove my skills that I have learned. I
                    was
                    stoked, ready to meet new people and see their perspectives. Usually team work can be quite
                    daunting,
                    resulting in the all too familiar "one person does everything, the rest watches" scheme of academic
                    life. But working with the software engineers was like getting thrown into a detailed and fast paced
                    rythm
                    with presentations every week and trying to juggle communication between design and software
                    engineering
                    students as well as lecturers, professors and the client. It was a challenge, but I had the pleasure
                    to
                    work with a very nice team of students.
                    <br><br>
                    This is where I learned an often overlooked personal skill you
                    should have when you work in a team: be nice. It sounds trivial, almost unimportant, but
                    productiveness
                    increases so much when you don't dread coming to the meetings. It does not mean you have to be best
                    friends with everyone; it's okay to keep a professional distance. Howevver, being able not to take
                    things personally, giving your team members the benefit of the doubt, and letting them explain
                    themselves when things don't go perfectly is important. Transparent communication and understanding
                    the
                    hurdles
                    that come in working with someone from a different field are necessary. I quickly realised that one
                    of
                    the most valued but overlooked skills is the ability of a designer to clearly express an idea
                    visually.
                    What you usually would need hours of discussion for can be very quickly explained in simple
                    drawings.
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, this group project helped me both recognise my own unique skills as a designer as well as see
                    what
                    programmers do and how they think. I enjoyed this experience greatly. Oh, and we won the competition!
