         <p><b>Description</b>
            <br>Germany is a peculiar case when it comes to cashless payments. Though highly regarded as technologically
            advanced, vistors often find themselves stumped when trying to pay in a large number of establishments with
            their credit cards, just to be told it's cash only. We carry an average of approximately 103€ in cash, three
            times more than in France. Our neighbours in the Netherlands pay only 45% of their transactions by cash
            while in
            Germany it's a whole 80%

            sovanta AG creates business apps but often comes to our faculty to collaborate with the students. In fall of
            2017, they joined our navigation design class, mentored by Prof. Veruschka Götz. The question of that
            semester was: what else can you do with cashless payments? Let's create a system that can be implemented
            within the near future and offers a different point of view. We started by discussing the current state of
            cashless options for Germans and what the benefits and disadvantages are. </p>

         <h3>Process</h3>
         <p>
            Our first sketches revolved around solving friction in your every day handling of financial decisions. We
            thought about different ways to display your current financial status other than classical diagrams and
            numbers. Afterwards, we shifted to in-store payments. I always felt like the shopping experience inside
            of a grocery store could be greatly improved. Craning your neck in all kinds of directions to look for the
            price tag, reading tiny ingredient lists to find your allergens or just fumbling for change in your wallet
            in the 10 seconds you have at the end of the cash register.
            <br><br>
            So we thought about how to make this whole process easier. Amazon Go is a concept that we looked at, which
            had a similar idea of walking in, taking your product and just leaving, everything else being taken care
            of in the background. We still felt like it lacked a few things, such as theft protection and giving more
            information to the buyer. What if the product was out of stock? What if I don't want everything to be
            connected to my phone? Questions like these pushed us further.
         </p>

      <div class="process">
         <p>
            We decided to go for an entirely new device. Small and credit card sized, independent from your phone. It
            should
            help you keep track of what you're adding to your cart without a manual scanning process. So the cart will
            be a big scanner by itself. Using RFID tags, products can pass the opening of a cart and be scanned at the
            same time. You can implement the same scanner tech into shopping bags. Once placed into your bag or cart,
            the items are marked as "pending." When you press "pay," all items will turn to the status "purchased."
            <br><br>
            Those tags can also prevent theft, as the long scannable range make it possible for entrances to have
            detectors that can set off an alarm if unpaid items pass by. A lot of fashion stores already use similar
            technology.
            <br><br>
            The information will also not go to waste. At home you can also add the same scanners to your cupboard etc.
            to keep track of what you have stocked. Besides, each tag can store more information other than just name
            and price. It can show you the ingredients and highlight preset words. It can keep track of all the E
            Numbers and display everything in multiple languages, as I would've loved to have when I was in Korea or
            Japan.
         </p>

            So the shopping process will be as follows:
            You enter the shop with your tap card.
            <br><br>
            You can unlock your tap card and attach it to your cart or bag. The cart is expandable, in case you need
            more space.
            <br><br>
            When still on the shelf, items are set as "unpaid." The moment you place them into your bag or cart, they
            will change to "pending," as no payment has been made, yet. Take them out and they will change back to
            "unpaid." Within the cart or bag they will be added to your card and you can watch how much it adds up.
            <br><br>
            In case the item is too large or out of stock you can scan the tag by hand and add it as an item to be
            delivered.
            <br><br>
            When you're done shopping, one tap and the payment is sent. We think it is crucial to give the buyer one
            last moment to check everything in order to prevent mistakes.
         </p>

         <h3>Conclusion</h3>
         <p>
            Distrust and inconvenience are the main reasons why Germans are still wary of cashless payments. It
            seems more difficult and costly to set up a credit card, and it's worrisome thinking about how much personal
            data is attached to it.
            Sandra and I spent a lot of time thinking about what emotions are associated with spending money. WWe
            thought about where a lot of financial decisions are made and where frictions regarding transactions emerge.
            <br><br>
            While the concept has its perks, there are still flaws and questions left unanswered. What happens when you
            buy fresh produce? Do you need a cart if you pick up only one thing? What if you lose the card and how is it
            connected to everything? Is it prepaid? There's a lot to figure out when you create a concept
            for a future you're still uncertain of.
